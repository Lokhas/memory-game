# Memory Game Project

This game is part of one of the Udacity's Nanodegrees.
To play it, you need to download and extract the .zip file, then open index.html on your browser.

## How to play

You need to find the pairs in as little time and moves as possible.
Winning the game with less than 15 moves will give you 3 stars, with less than 20 moves it'll be 2 stars, then it will only be 1 star.


## Help for this project

The starter repository for this project is available [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).
The shuffle function can be found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976).
Finally, I had a hard time with the listener event for clicked cards and also with trying to compare cards. I found help in this [Study Jam Session](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976) from Yahya Elharony.
